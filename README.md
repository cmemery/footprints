Connect to Numara Footprints SOAP api using python

This is a pretty bare-bones module that should help you
at least get started if you're trying to work with the
BMC FootPrints service desk application API.

Version 2.0 works with FP v12.1. Use v1.0 for FP 11.

Version 2 adds a dependency on zeep, so I've added
a requirements file to install dependencies.
